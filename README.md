# types-roll20-CommandShell
Type definition file for Roll20 [CommandShell](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/CommandShell) API script.

## NPM
I may publish the definition files on the public registry at some points, until then, I've created a roll20 feed on my MyGet account. 
All my roll20 stuff are accessible there: [https://www.myget.org/F/roll20/npm/](https://www.myget.org/F/roll20/npm/).
